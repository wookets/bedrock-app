# Bedrock App (aka hello bedrock)

This application is built on tanstack start. 

## Dev

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deploy

There is a very basic Dockerfile that can be used to build a container of this app for deployment on ECS.
